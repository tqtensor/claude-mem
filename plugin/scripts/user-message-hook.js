\u26A0\uFE0F  Claude-Mem: First-Time Setup

Dependencies have been installed in the background. This only happens once.

\u{1F4A1} TIPS:
   \u2022 Memories will start generating while you work
   \u2022 Use /init to write or update your CLAUDE.md for better project context
   \u2022 Try /clear after one session to see what context looks like

Thank you for installing Claude-Mem!

This message was not added to your startup context, so you can continue working as normal.
