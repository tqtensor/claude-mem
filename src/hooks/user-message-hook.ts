⚠️  Claude-Mem: First-Time Setup

Dependencies have been installed in the background. This only happens once.

💡 TIPS:
   • Memories will start generating while you work
   • Use /init to write or update your CLAUDE.md for better project context
   • Try /clear after one session to see what context looks like

Thank you for installing Claude-Mem!

This message was not added to your startup context, so you can continue working as normal.
