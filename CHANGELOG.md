## [5.4.0] - 2025-11-09

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: MCP Search Tools Removed

**Migration**: None required. Claude automatically uses the search skill when needed.

### Changed
- **Skill-Based Search Architecture**: Replaced MCP search tools with skill-based HTTP API
  - **Token Savings**: ~2,250 tokens per session start
  - **Progressive Disclosure**: Skill frontmatter (~250 tokens) vs MCP tool definitions (~2,500 tokens)
  - Search functionality works identically but with better efficiency
  - No user action required - migration is transparent

### Added
- **10 New HTTP Search API Endpoints** in worker service:
  - `GET /api/search/observations` - Full-text search observations
  - `GET /api/search/sessions` - Full-text search session summaries
  - `GET /api/search/prompts` - Full-text search user prompts
  - `GET /api/search/by-concept` - Find observations by concept tag
  - `GET /api/search/by-file` - Find work related to specific files
  - `GET /api/search/by-type` - Find observations by type (bugfix, feature, etc.)
  - `GET /api/context/recent` - Get recent session context
  - `GET /api/context/timeline` - Get timeline around specific point in time
  - `GET /api/timeline/by-query` - Search + timeline in one call
  - `GET /api/search/help` - API documentation
- **Search Skill** (`plugin/skills/search/SKILL.md`):
  - Auto-invoked when users ask about past work, decisions, or history
  - Comprehensive documentation with usage examples and workflows
  - Format guidelines for presenting search results

### Removed
- **MCP Search Server** (deprecated):
  - Removed `claude-mem-search` from plugin/.mcp.json
  - Build script no longer compiles search-server.mjs
  - Source file kept for reference: src/servers/search-server.ts
  - All 9 MCP tools replaced by equivalent HTTP API endpoints

### Technical Details
- **How It Works**: User asks → Claude recognizes intent → Invokes search skill → Skill uses curl to call HTTP API → Formats results
- **User Experience**: Identical search capabilities with significantly lower context overhead
- **Performance**: Same search speed, better session start performance

  - Removed hardcoded paths in context hook, worker service, and SDK integration
  - Now uses dynamic path resolution for cross-platform compatibility
  - Affects: `src/hooks/context.ts`, `src/services/worker-service.ts`, `src/sdk/worker.ts`


## [4.2.11] - 2025-10-25

### Fixed
- **Cross-platform Claude path detection**: Fixed SDK auto-detection failure by implementing explicit `which`/`where` command execution
  - SDK's automatic Claude path detection was returning undefined
  - Unix/macOS: Uses `which claude` command to find executable
  - Windows: Uses `where claude` command (works in both CMD and PowerShell)
  - Fallback to `CLAUDE_CODE_PATH` environment variable if set
  - Handles Windows multiple results by taking first match
  - Worker now logs discovered path for debugging: "Found Claude executable: /path/to/claude"

- Platform detection via `process.platform === 'win32'` to choose appropriate command
- Updated `src/sdk/worker.ts` and `src/services/worker-service.ts` with explicit path detection
- Both files now pass `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable: claudePath` to SDK query


## [4.2.10] - 2025-10-25

### Fixed

  - Added comprehensive test suite with 332 new tests covering injection scenarios
  - Affects: `search_observations`, `search_sessions`, `search_user_prompts` MCP tools

### Fixed
- **ESM/CJS compatibility**: Fixed getDirname function to work in both ESM (hooks) and CJS (worker) contexts
  - Detects context using `typeof __dirname !== 'undefined'`
  - Falls back to `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` for ESM modules
  - Resolves path resolution issues across different module systems
- **Windows PowerShell compatibility**: Fixed SessionStart hook error on Windows systems
  - Replaced bash-specific test command `[` with standard cross-platform npm install
  - Simplified hook command to use idempotent npm install (fast when dependencies exist)
  - Dependencies install from root package.json in marketplace folder

### Changed
- **SessionStart hook command**: Now uses `cd ... && npm install --prefer-offline --no-audit --no-fund --loglevel=error && node context-hook.js`
  - Removed bash-specific conditional check

  - New "WHEN NOT TO SUMMARIZE" section in buildSummaryPrompt guides SDK to avoid duplicate/trivial summaries
  - Parser detects `<skip_summary reason="..."/>` format and logs reason
  - Prevents duplicate summaries like the three "restore 6 types" summaries observed in session d9137878

### Fixed
- **Observation type validation**: Parser now validates all 6 observation types (bugfix, feature, refactor, change, discovery, decision) instead of only 3

### Changed
- **Chronological summary guidance**: Summaries now explicitly instructed to capture "what happened in THIS prompt" rather than re-summarizing previous work


## [4.1.1] - 2025-10-21

### Removed
- **advanced_search tool**: Removed redundant MCP tool that provided no functionality beyond calling search_observations + search_sessions

### Fixed
- **MCP search limit bug**: Fixed findByConcept, findByType, and findByFile methods to properly respect limit/offset parameters
- **Type contamination in concepts**: Added parser validation to prevent observation types from being added to concepts array
- **Token limit warnings**: Added guidance in tool descriptions to start with 3-5 results to avoid MCP token limits

### Changed
- **Simplified MCP API**: Reduced from 7 to 6 search tools by removing the redundant advanced_search
- **Improved search prompts**: Enhanced type and concept constraint language in SDK prompts to prevent AI contamination


## [4.1.0] - 2025-10-21

### Changed
- **Graceful session cleanup**: Cleanup hook now marks sessions as completed instead of sending DELETE requests to worker
- **Natural worker shutdown**: Workers now finish pending operations (like summary generation) before terminating

## [4.0.2] - 2025-10-19

### Changed
- **PM2 bundled as dependency**: Moved pm2 from devDependencies to dependencies for out-of-the-box functionality
- **Worker scripts use local PM2**: All npm worker scripts now use `npx pm2` to ensure local binary is used
- **Worker startup uses local PM2**: Worker auto-start now uses `node_modules/.bin/pm2` instead of global pm2

### Fixed
- **Fail loudly on missing dependencies**: Worker startup now throws explicit errors when bundled pm2 is missing instead of silently falling back
- **Better error messages**: Clear actionable error messages guide users to run `npm install` when dependencies are missing
- **Removed silent fallback**: Eliminated silent degradation that masked "works on my machine" installation failures

### Documentation
- Updated README system requirements to reflect pm2 is bundled with plugin (no global install required)


## [4.0.0] - 2025-10-18
